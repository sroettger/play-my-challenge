# pwngdb

Are you tired of debugging binaries in your terminal? Try out this next gen web UI for gdb.

It comes with all the important features:
* cyber CSS
* assembly view with registers, maps and memory
* breakpoints
* regex search
* clickable addresses
* runs /bin/sleep natively

If you can get code execution, try to read `/home/user/flag`.
